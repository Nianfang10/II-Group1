___
The goal is to implement and train a DNN to classify the pixels on remote sensing images.  

First we use a traditional classification method [to be determined], the performance of it:
| Method      | Validate Acc. |Test Acc.|
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| K-means     | wrs         |           |

The architecture of our deep neural network:  
(1) First  model  
(2) Second model  

The accuracy of the network:  
| DNN         | Validate Acc. |Test Acc.|
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| model 1      | 95.0626%   |  96.3105% |
| Paragraph   | asdf        |           |
